To run Part 1 in a Linux Enironment, follow the following steps:
1. Download and save the part2.cpp file and input1.txt file in a directory that you want to compile it on.
2. Once you have moved both of the files in your preferred directory, open up the terminal.
3. You'll need to create the disk. Use cd command to get to the correct directory then run command: gcc lab3.create_fs.c -o create_fs
4. Then run command: ./create_fs disk0
4. Run the following command:gcc part2.cpp -o part2
5. This will create an executable c program called part2.
6. Then, run this code on the terminal:./part2
7. This will lead to a printout on your terminal, meaning that the program has completed.

The design choices implemented for the C file make it easier for the user to understand the code as you progress through it, moreoever, variable names are relavent so that the user is aware of what each variable does and can follow along. Methods naming scheme shoudl be easy to follow.
